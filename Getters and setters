/* You can obtain values from an object and set the value of a property within an object.
Getter functions are meant to simply return (get) the value of an object's private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.
Setter functions are meant to modify (set) the value of an object's private variable based on the value passed into the setter function. 
These are classically called getters and setters. */

//The getter is programmed to return a value in celsius so since the value was previously stored in fahrenheit, it has to convert the stored value to Celsius. The setter is programmed to accept a value in celsius, but store it in fahrenheit so it has to convert the value that was passed to fahrenheit.

const thermos = new Thermostat(76); // Setting in Fahrenheit scale
let temp = thermos.temperature; // 24.44 in Celsius
